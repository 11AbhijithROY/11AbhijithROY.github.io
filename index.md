# Hello!

#### I'm a Senior AI/ML Engineer/Team Lead at JobSciences, a University of Melbourne startup helping students and young working professionals find their career path in life. I have over two years experience as an AI/ML Engineer working with structured and unstructured healthcare data at the second largest US healthcare company (Elevance Health). My mission with data science and machine learning lies at the intersection of data, policy planning and sociology, helping communities, public and private institutions make data driver decisions and make better policies. My research interests lies broadly in Natural Language Processing, particularly in Representation Learning, Ontology Engineering, and Ethical AI. I was advised by [Dr. A. Santhanavijayan](https://nitt.irins.org/profile/93079) during my undergraduate thesis and [Dr. Gerard Deepak](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=miP5DQ8AAAAJ&hl=en) during my time as a research assistant at NIT, Trichy. 

I also like to pictures of the sky and give [movie reviews](https://letterboxd.com/feluba/). For a more comprehensive read, check out my [CV](pdf/abhijithscv.pdf). 

## Industry Experience

**Senior AI/ML Engineer/Team Lead @ JobSciences, Melbourne (_October 2025 - Present_)**

- Designed and deployed scalable indexing algorithms for skill–job title mapping as FastAPI microservices, incorporating precision@k and CTR tracking.
- Leading a team of interns to develop ML lifecycles and taxonomies for personalized job and skill recommendation pipelines.
- Prototyping a GPT-4–based job pathway predictor using Australian labour datasets and graph edge-removal algorithms for career mapping.
**AI Consultant @ Client, Melbourne (_October 2025 - Present_)**

- Built a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) prototype using vector databases and task embeddings to improve LLM-driven task retrieval and generation.
- Developing a production-grade retrieval system that enables dynamic task orchestration from both structured tasks data.
  
**Data Scientist @ Carelon Global Solutions LLP (Elevance Health INC) (_July 2023 - Present_)**
- Deployed a Generate AI dashboard utilising RAG techniques to ground LLMs and multi agent approach to implement an HPMS chatbot to answer queries about the US Healthcare domain and internal documents.
- Deployed an LLM powered claims process classifier to judge based on patient documents, whether the the patient's claim can be approved, denied, or uncertain.
- Deployed a scalable LLM-OCR pipeline to extract any set of medical documents to parse the required fields and give you suggestions to fill in the blanks in medical/insurance forms.

**Cloud Developer Intern @ Carelon Global Solutions LLP (_May 2022 - August 2022_)**
- Deployed AWS Step functions and Lambdas to help vendors deploy work spaces on cloud platforms.
- Developed a chat bot that uses natural language query to output (PostgreSQL) billing details for auditing purposes.
